Given a collection of documents (pitch decks, transcripts, etc.), 
analyze them and generate structured deal notes. 

The deal notes should include the following info:
Company overview and business model summary, 
Founders details, 
Funding round details, 
Amount raised in each funding round, 
Major investors or lead investors involved in the round, 
Broad type of security issued (e.g., preferred shares, convertible notes), 
General intended use of proceeds (e.g., expansion, technology, market growth), 
High-level financial metrics (revenue, growth rate, profitability trends), 
Key milestones achieved or cited by the company, 
Public statements on company vision or strategic direction. 

These parameters, typically found through press releases, investment databases, 
IPO prospectuses, or company disclosures.

citing sources if used any external public sources.
